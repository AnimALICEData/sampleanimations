# Welcome!

Welcome to ALICE Blender Animation Webpage! This site was created with the intent of publishing results of the ALICE Blender Animation project, available on its [Github repository](https://github.com/AnimALICEData/ALICE-Blender-Animation). Stick around to check out ALICE particle collision events in 3D!

# Description

This project generates 3D animations of particle collision events, from LHC's ALICE detector, using data available at [CERN's Open Data Portal](http://opendata.cern.ch/). Several bits of code run in order to extract relevant information about the events, create animated scenes with Blender, a free and open source software for 3D modeling, and render them into videos. Check out the [Github repository](https://github.com/AnimALICEData/ALICE-Blender-Animation) for more information.

## Samples by type and multiplicity

The clips below are sorted by type of collision, which refers to either Pb-Pb collisions (Lead ions) or p-p collisions (protons); and multiplicity, which is the number of particles in the event.

### Pb-Pb

* Low multiplicity

Minimum multiplicity: 20

Maximum multiplicity: 50

## Samples with high average z-momentum (Pz)

The following clips were generated with the setting of minimum average Pz (momentum in the z-direction) equal to 1.0 GeV/c. That means the average of the z-component momentum of all particles has absolute value greater than 1 GeV/c, which is likely to select events with boosts of particles to one side or another.

## Different cameras

These clips were generated with different cameras than the usual.
