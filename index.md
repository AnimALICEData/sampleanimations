# Welcome!

Welcome to ALICE Blender Animation Webpage! This site was created with the intent of publishing results of the ALICE Blender Animation project, available on its [Github repository](https://github.com/AnimALICEData/ALICE-Blender-Animation). Stick around to check out ALICE particle collision events in 3D!

# Description

This project generates 3D animations of particle collision events, from LHC's ALICE detector, using data available at [CERN's Open Data Portal](http://opendata.cern.ch/). Several bits of code run in order to extract relevant information about the events, create animated scenes with Blender, a free and open source software for 3D modeling, and render them into videos. Check out the [Github repository](https://github.com/AnimALICEData/ALICE-Blender-Animation) for more information.
